The current best source for player attributes (such as reach and guile) is [[Astrology|https://astrology-next.vercel.app/]]. (Combined stars are shown by default; there's a toggle on the bottom for individual attributes.) [[Source here|https://github.com/teagrrl/astrology-next]].

Historical tools below this line:

The past source for Beta-era "apple stats" (such as divinity and shakesperianism) was [[this player viewer|https://blaseballplayers.netlify.app/]]. It features robust searching and filtering, the ability to save subsets of players for easy comparison, as well as noting additions/subtractions due to items in italics.

It's brought to you by Astrid, and it's currently a work in progress. [[Contribute to the source here|https://github.com/xSke/blaseball-player-list]]. If you'd like, you can also support Astrid's efforts directly through her [[Patreon|https://www.patreon.com/floofstrid]].

There's also (historical, not to be confused with the above Coronation-era) [[Legacy Astrology|https://astrology-next.vercel.app/legacy/teams]] from yoori - it does not have the search/filter functions, but does include derived ratings along some metrics, modifications, and fast load times. (Combined stars are shown by default; there's a toggle on the bottom for individual apple stats.) [[Source here|https://github.com/teagrrl/astrology/tree/master/astrology]]. 

Other past player viewers were [[Abslve|https://slavfox.space/abslve/#SUN]] and [[the original viewer|https://stlats.sibr.dev]].
