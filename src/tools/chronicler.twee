:: Chronicler

Chronicler brings together game events and other data from the [[official API|OfficialAPI]] into a form that makes historical comparisons easier. It's brought to you by Astrid.

API documentation [[here|https://docs.sibr.dev/]]. A full list of update types is [[here|https://github.com/xSke/Chronicler/blob/main/SIBR.Storage.Data/Models/UpdateType.cs]]. Like for the official API, you can also use the {{{csv.sibr.dev}}} tool - you can replace an {{{api.sibr.dev}}} URL with {{{csv.sibr.dev}}} if that's a better format for you than JSON.

There will always be some delay between updates on the official API and Chronicler. If you need events in an at-bat as opposed to per-pitch format, you're better off using [[Datablase]]. If you'd like to use Python, [[there's a wrapper available|Mike]]. If you'd like more robust search of the Expansion Era Feed, you're probably better off using [[Eventually]].
