The current best source of user styles in Coronation is [[this Google Doc|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bh0fbrZpxrP-mGm311zM3lbE5Z0fZmFMWCN7-3AuTsI/edit]], by Woosh. Any questions or comments can be directed to @@.channel;#user-styles@@ in Major Projects. 

The listing below is historical for resources that existed in Discipline/Expansion. 

[[Blaseball Compact|https://thevdude.github.io/BlaseballCompact/]] is a Stylus userstyle to fit blaseball games during the regular season in a 3 x 4 grid. Consumer Contrast (at the same link) makes CONSUMERS stand out more on the page. Both are brought to you by theVdude.

[[Emoji fix|https://holmesmr.github.io/Blaseball-Userstyles/]] is another Stylus userstyle to fix the emoji of the Spies, Fridays, and Mechs, and un-ORBs the Talkers. It's brought to you by Cepheus. Note that the 'BIG SCREEN BLASEBALL' style on this page is a prereq to Compact, but was not updated to fit the 2 extra games per day that were started in Season 13, and may fail completely in Short Circuits.

[[Blaseball+|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blaseball-plus/]] adds functionality such as [[Reblase]] and [[Abslve|PlayerViewers][$discussion_channel to "astrids-player-table"]] links for Firefox. It's brought to you by leo60228. 

[[blaseball-lr|https://github.com/Absotively/blaseball-lr]] is yet another Stylus user style, adding small markers to the Short Circuits betting page for noting left vs. right - most useful in Dutch betting sytems. It's borugh tot you by Absotively.
