:: Bricks

[[Bricks|https://bricks.sibr.dev]] brings together various statistics and box scores in one place, focused on Short Circuits play. 

You can choose within a single SC season to look at any team or single player view. The team view includes a W/L over .500 chart; clicking on an individual bar will show the box score for that game.
