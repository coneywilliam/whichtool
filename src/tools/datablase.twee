<<set $discussion_channel to "ðŸ’½-datablase">>

The ''Datablase'' is our fancy name for a stack of technology that does the following:
1) Ingest raw data from [[Chronicler]]
2) Change it from individual-pitch events to per-atbat events
3) Store it in a PostgreSQL DB
4) Expose API endpoints for the DB

The major Github projects that constitute the Datablase are:

[[Citadel|https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/citadel]]
Coronation Era Chronicler to Datablase Loader, in Python. 

[[Prophesizer|https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/prophesizer]]
C# application that parses raw game updates into game events describing all the pitches that happened during an at-bat (mostly). (Discipline/Expansion only, here for reference.)

[[Datablase|https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/datablase]]
Javascript application that exposes API endpoints for fetching DB information.
[[blaseball-reference.com|BlaseballReference]] uses these APIs to drive its content.

For more information on any of these, visit the @@.channel;#ðŸ’½-datablase@@ channel on the SIBR Discord. You'll need access to the 'ðŸ’¼ Major Projects' role in @@.channel;#roles-and-sigils@@ to see it.
