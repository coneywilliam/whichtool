:: blaseball.vcr

blaseball.vcr is an offline copy of the [[Chronicler]] API, giving you access to SIBR's entire archive of Blaseball history using just 200MB of disk space.  

It powered [[Project Voyager|https://faculty.sibr.dev/~iliana/voyager/rc4/]], where we fit the entirety of Blaseball's beta into a CD-R. You can download the latest Linux release [[here|https://github.com/alisww/blaseball.vcr/releases]].

It's made by emily (sapphicfettucine#6248), and you can find the source code on [[this github repo|https://github.com/emily-signet/blaseball.vcr]].
